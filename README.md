# Hands on Swift Playgrounds for iPad

This playgrounds will show you how to code :) Not from the very beginning, but with super funny features. The first features in this playground will show you how to use the Mircosoft Cognitive Services APIs within fun and easy to learn scenarios.

## What specific APIs will I learn?
The first APIs out of this huge suite will be the
- Computer Vision API
- Emotion API
- and the Speech API
To get going with those technologies the examples in the playground will get you kick started into the topic :)

##Details on the playground
The Playground is compatible with the Swift Playground App, currently iOS 10 Beta 7, and Xcode 8 Beta 6. Because the feature is so brand new, Xcode 8 Beta 4 wasn't completely supporting all playground features. I won't be able to deliver downward-compatibility. So just keep track with the latest versions.

##How the heck can I get this playground onto my iPad
With Airdrop - Just that easy :D But make sure that you are using Mac OS 10.11.6. I encountered connectivity troubles between the iPad and MacBook Pro when running under Mac OS 10.11.4.

##Support?
I will try to get back to you if you have any trouble using the playgrounds. But as this is kind of a side project by now, please be patient
